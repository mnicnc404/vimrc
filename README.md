This is my personal Vim configuration.
Iâ€™m still learning Vim, so donâ€™t be surprised if some things look a bit odd.

## Installation

0. I primarily use Python at work, so make sure `flake8` is installed:
   `pip install flake8` or `conda install flake8`
1. [Install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
2. Place `.vimrc` in your home directory (`~/` or `~/.vim/`)
3. Run `vim -c "PlugInstall"` to install all plugins
