My personal vim configuration file.

I'm a newbie to Vim so don't be surprised if you see something weird.

## Installation

0. I mostly use python at work so make sure you have flake8 installed (`pip/conda install flake8`).
1. [Install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
2. Put `.vimrc` in your `~` or `~/.vim/`.
3. `vim -c "PlugInstall"` to install all other dependencies.
