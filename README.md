My personal vim configuration file.

I'm a newbie to Vim so don't be surprised if you see something weird.

## Installation

0. Make sure your vim is built with python3 support and have powerline installed. If no, just remove line 56~61.
1. [Install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
2. Put `.vimrc` in your `~` or `~/.vim/`.
3. `vim -c "PlugInstall"` to install all other dependencies.
